# Product Overview

This is a game development workshop project for AWS Re:Invent. The repository serves as a starting point for participants to build browser-based games with AI assistance.

## Current Implementation

The project includes a working example: **Retro Moon Lander** - a classic arcade-style game where players pilot a lunar lander to safely land on designated pads while managing fuel and velocity.

## Workshop Goals

- Help developers of all skill levels build games collaboratively with AI
- Demonstrate rapid prototyping and iterative development
- Showcase creative integration of visual and audio effects
- Encourage experimentation with different languages and frameworks

## Design Philosophy

- Start small, build smart - begin with core gameplay before adding polish
- Iterative development with user feedback after each task
- Creative freedom in implementation choices (language, framework, style)
- Use of Kiro branding elements (logo, colors) for visual consistency
