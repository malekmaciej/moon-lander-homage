# Technology Stack

## Current Implementation

The example game uses vanilla web technologies:

- **HTML5** - Structure and canvas element
- **CSS3** - Styling with dark theme and retro aesthetic
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Game logic, physics, and rendering
- **Canvas API** - 2D graphics rendering

## Build System

No build system required for the current implementation. Games run directly in the browser.

## Common Commands

Since this is a static HTML/JS project:

- **Run locally**: Open `moon-lander.html` in a web browser
- **Development**: Use any local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or VS Code Live Server)
- **No compilation needed**: Changes are immediately visible on page refresh

## Framework Flexibility

The workshop supports multiple approaches:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (current example)
- Game frameworks (Phaser, PixiJS, Three.js)
- Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte)
- Any language that compiles to web (TypeScript, Elm, etc.)

**Always ask the user for their preferred language and framework before starting.**

## Assets

- `kiro-logo.png` - Available as a game sprite or UI element
- Embedded styles and scripts in HTML for simplicity
